# Good Morning! It's THURSDAY, August 14, 2025

## Getting In To Your VMs:

- Go to https://class.hypertheory-labs.com/guacamole
- Use your `studentX` username and the password is Hypertheory_Training!
- At the black and white login screen, the username is a `student`, and the password is the password you set yesterday.

- **Please Start Docker Desktop**
- **Let Me Know If You Need Help**

## Today

- Catalog Items
    - Desinging APIs
    - Non-Controller Based APIs (formerly known as "Minimal APIs")
        - Open API
    - POST/PUT/GET/DELETE


- Red Flag API Design Things

- Having resources (URLs) that have "verbs" in them. e.g. `GET /customers/32/delete` or `POST /orders/83983/ship`
- Using "safe" http methods to do unsafe things.
    - the "safe" HTTP methods are GET. Period.
    - the "unsafe" methods are POST, PUT, DELETE

- Caching - GET requests should be cacheable. (some post requests can be, but that's weird), but POST and DELETE aren't.

- URLs are for humans. Other developers. They help them reason about the use of the API.


GET /vendors
POST /vendors

- Returning 400 for every error. Try to make errors impossible, and without that, try to rely on the HTTP errors.

```http
POST /vendors
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "tacos": "Good"
}
```

```
400 Bad Request

{
    ... 
}
